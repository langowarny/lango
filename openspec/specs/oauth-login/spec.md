## REMOVED

**Status**: Removed (2026-02-14)
**Reason**: OAuth with AI providers risks account bans. Use API key authentication instead.

**Migration**: Remove `clientId`, `clientSecret`, and `scopes` from provider configuration. Set `apiKey` using environment variable references (e.g., `${GOOGLE_API_KEY}`).
