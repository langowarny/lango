## Purpose

Discord channel adapter for the Lango agent. Connects to Discord via Bot API, handles message reception (DMs and mentions), slash commands, approval workflows, and typing indicators.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Discord bot connection
The system SHALL connect to Discord using the Bot API with a provided bot token.

#### Scenario: Successful bot connection
- **WHEN** the application starts with a valid DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN
- **THEN** the system SHALL establish a gateway connection to Discord

#### Scenario: Gateway reconnection
- **WHEN** the Discord gateway connection drops
- **THEN** the system SHALL automatically reconnect with session resumption

### Requirement: Message reception
The system SHALL receive and process incoming messages from Discord channels.

#### Scenario: Direct message received
- **WHEN** a user sends a DM to the bot
- **THEN** the message SHALL be forwarded to the agent

#### Scenario: Channel message with mention
- **WHEN** a user mentions the bot in a text channel
- **THEN** the message SHALL be processed if the channel is configured

### Requirement: Discord message handler context propagation
The Discord `Channel` SHALL propagate the `Start(ctx)` context to message handler callbacks. The `Channel` struct SHALL store the context passed to `Start(ctx)` and use it when invoking the message handler in `onMessageCreate`, instead of using `context.Background()`.

#### Scenario: Start context propagated to handler
- **WHEN** `Channel.Start(ctx)` is called with a context containing cancellation or deadline
- **AND** a message is received via `onMessageCreate`
- **THEN** the handler SHALL be invoked with the stored `Start` context (not `context.Background()`)

#### Scenario: Context carries session key downstream
- **WHEN** a Discord message triggers `onMessageCreate`
- **AND** the handler injects a session key into the propagated context
- **THEN** downstream approval providers SHALL be able to extract the session key via `session.SessionKeyFromContext`

### Requirement: Slash command support
The system SHALL register and handle Discord slash commands.

#### Scenario: Slash command registration
- **WHEN** the bot connects to Discord
- **THEN** configured slash commands SHALL be registered with the Discord API

#### Scenario: Slash command invocation
- **WHEN** a user invokes a slash command
- **THEN** the system SHALL execute the corresponding handler

### Requirement: Message sending
The system SHALL send agent responses back to Discord channels.

#### Scenario: Send text response
- **WHEN** the agent generates a response
- **THEN** the response SHALL be sent to the originating channel

#### Scenario: Discord markdown formatting
- **WHEN** a response contains markdown
- **THEN** the response SHALL use Discord-compatible markdown syntax

### Requirement: Guild configuration
The system SHALL support per-guild configuration for Discord servers.

#### Scenario: Guild-specific settings
- **WHEN** a guild has custom configuration
- **THEN** the bot SHALL use guild-specific settings for that server

### Requirement: Discord approval provider
The Discord channel SHALL provide an approval provider that uses Message Component buttons for tool execution approval.

#### Scenario: Approval message sent
- **WHEN** a sensitive tool approval is requested for a Discord session
- **THEN** the system SHALL send a message with an ActionsRow containing "Approve" (success style) and "Deny" (danger style) buttons to the originating channel

#### Scenario: User approves
- **WHEN** the user clicks the "Approve" button
- **THEN** the interaction SHALL be responded to with an updated message (buttons removed)
- **AND** the tool execution SHALL proceed

#### Scenario: User denies
- **WHEN** the user clicks the "Deny" button
- **THEN** the interaction SHALL be responded to with an updated message (buttons removed)
- **AND** the tool execution SHALL be denied

#### Scenario: Approval timeout
- **WHEN** no button is clicked within the timeout period
- **THEN** the approval request SHALL be denied with a timeout error

### Requirement: Interaction handler registration
The Discord channel SHALL register an InteractionCreate handler at startup to route message component interactions to the approval provider.

#### Scenario: InteractionCreate received
- **WHEN** an InteractionCreate event of type InteractionMessageComponent is received
- **THEN** the event SHALL be routed to the approval provider's HandleInteraction method

### Requirement: Session interface extensions
The Discord Session interface SHALL include `InteractionRespond` and `ChannelMessageEditComplex` methods for approval interaction handling.

#### Scenario: Respond to interaction
- **WHEN** a button interaction needs to be acknowledged
- **THEN** the system SHALL use `InteractionRespond` to update the original message

### Requirement: Approval message editing on timeout and cancellation
The Discord approval provider SHALL edit the approval message to display "Expired" status and remove button components when the approval times out or the context is cancelled.

#### Scenario: Timeout removes buttons
- **WHEN** an approval request times out without user response
- **THEN** the system SHALL call ChannelMessageEditComplex with content "🔐 Tool approval — ⏱ Expired" and empty Components slice

#### Scenario: Context cancellation removes buttons
- **WHEN** the approval request context is cancelled
- **THEN** the system SHALL call ChannelMessageEditComplex with expired content and empty Components

### Requirement: Message ID capture for timeout editing
The Discord approval provider SHALL capture the message ID from ChannelMessageSendComplex return value and store it in an approvalPending struct for use in timeout/cancellation message editing.

#### Scenario: Sent message ID stored in pending struct
- **WHEN** an approval message is sent successfully
- **THEN** the system SHALL store the returned message ID alongside the response channel and channel ID in an approvalPending struct
### Requirement: Typing indicator during processing
The Discord channel SHALL show a typing indicator while the message handler processes a user message. The `Session` interface SHALL include `ChannelTyping`. The typing indicator SHALL be sent via `ChannelTyping` immediately and refreshed every 8 seconds until the handler returns.

#### Scenario: Typing indicator during processing
- **WHEN** a user sends a message (DM or mention) to the Discord bot
- **THEN** the bot SHALL call `ChannelTyping` on the channel before calling the handler
- **AND** SHALL refresh the typing indicator every 8 seconds
- **AND** SHALL stop refreshing when the handler returns

#### Scenario: Typing indicator API failure
- **WHEN** the `ChannelTyping` call fails
- **THEN** the bot SHALL log a warning and continue processing normally
