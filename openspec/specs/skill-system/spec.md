## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: File-Based Skill Storage
The system SHALL store skills as `<dir>/<name>/SKILL.md` files with YAML frontmatter containing name, description, type, status, and optional parameters. `ListActive()` SHALL skip hidden directories (names starting with `.`) when scanning.

#### Scenario: Save a new skill
- **WHEN** a skill entry is saved via `FileSkillStore.Save()`
- **THEN** the system SHALL create `<skillsDir>/<name>/SKILL.md` with YAML frontmatter and markdown body

#### Scenario: Load active skills
- **WHEN** `FileSkillStore.ListActive()` is called
- **THEN** all skills with `status: active` in their frontmatter SHALL be returned
- **AND** directories whose name starts with `.` SHALL be skipped without logging a warning

#### Scenario: Hidden directory ignored
- **WHEN** `FileSkillStore.ListActive()` encounters a directory starting with `.`
- **THEN** it SHALL skip the directory silently without attempting to parse its contents

#### Scenario: Delete a skill
- **WHEN** `FileSkillStore.Delete()` is called with a skill name
- **THEN** the entire `<skillsDir>/<name>/` directory SHALL be removed

#### Scenario: SaveResource writes file to correct path
- **WHEN** `SaveResource` is called with skillName="my-skill" and relPath="scripts/run.sh"
- **THEN** the file SHALL be written to `<store-dir>/my-skill/scripts/run.sh`

### Requirement: SKILL.md Parsing
The system SHALL parse SKILL.md files with YAML frontmatter delimited by `---` lines, extracting metadata and body content.

#### Scenario: Parse valid SKILL.md
- **WHEN** a file with valid YAML frontmatter and markdown body is parsed
- **THEN** a `SkillEntry` SHALL be returned with all frontmatter fields populated and definition extracted from code blocks

#### Scenario: Parse file without frontmatter
- **WHEN** a file without `---` delimiters is parsed
- **THEN** an error SHALL be returned

### Requirement: Embedded Default Skills
The system SHALL embed default skill files via `//go:embed **/SKILL.md`. When no real skill SKILL.md files are present, a `.placeholder/SKILL.md` file SHALL exist to satisfy the embed glob pattern. The placeholder SHALL NOT contain valid YAML frontmatter and SHALL NOT be deployed as a usable skill. `EnsureDefaults()` SHALL skip any embedded path whose directory name starts with `.` (hidden directories).

#### Scenario: Build with no real default skills
- **WHEN** `go build` is run with only `.placeholder/SKILL.md` in the skills directory
- **THEN** the build SHALL succeed without errors

#### Scenario: Placeholder not deployed as skill
- **WHEN** `EnsureDefaults()` iterates over the embedded filesystem
- **THEN** entries whose directory name starts with `.` SHALL be skipped entirely
- **AND** no files from `.placeholder/` SHALL be written to the user's skills directory

#### Scenario: Future skill addition
- **WHEN** a new `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` file with valid frontmatter is added
- **THEN** it SHALL be automatically included in the embedded filesystem and deployed via `EnsureDefaults()`

#### Scenario: Existing skills preserved
- **WHEN** `EnsureDefaults()` is called and a skill directory already exists
- **THEN** that skill SHALL NOT be overwritten

### Requirement: Independent Skill Configuration
The system SHALL use a separate `SkillConfig` with `Enabled` and `SkillsDir` fields, independent of `KnowledgeConfig`.

#### Scenario: Skill system disabled
- **WHEN** `skill.enabled` is false in config
- **THEN** no skills SHALL be loaded and skill tools SHALL NOT be registered

#### Scenario: Custom skills directory
- **WHEN** `skill.skillsDir` is set to a custom path
- **THEN** skills SHALL be read from and written to that directory

### Requirement: SkillProvider Interface
The system SHALL decouple the `ContextRetriever` from skill storage via a `SkillProvider` interface.

#### Scenario: Skill provider wired
- **WHEN** a `SkillProvider` is set on the `ContextRetriever`
- **THEN** skill context items SHALL be retrieved via the provider instead of the knowledge store

#### Scenario: No skill provider

- **THEN** `LoadSkills` SHALL load all active skills from the store

#### Scenario: App tool assembly with knowledge system
- **WHEN** the knowledge system is enabled and tools are assembled in `app.go`
- **THEN** the app SHALL use `LoadedSkills()` to append only dynamic skills
- **AND** SHALL NOT use `AllTools()` which would duplicate base tools already present in the tool list

### Requirement: Loaded Skills Retrieval
The registry SHALL provide a `LoadedSkills()` method that returns only dynamically loaded skill tools, excluding base tools.

#### Scenario: No skills loaded
- **WHEN** `LoadedSkills` is called before any skills are loaded

#### Scenario: Skills loaded
- **WHEN** `LoadedSkills` is called after skills have been activated
- **THEN** the system SHALL return only the dynamically loaded skill tools
- **AND** the result SHALL NOT include any base tools passed during registry creation

#### Scenario: Concurrent safety
- **WHEN** `LoadedSkills` is called concurrently with `LoadSkills`
- **THEN** access SHALL be protected by a read lock

### Requirement: Skill Executor
The system SHALL safely execute skills of three types: composite, script, and template.

### Requirement: Dangerous Pattern Validation
The system SHALL validate scripts against known dangerous patterns as a defense-in-depth measure.

#### Scenario: Reject dangerous scripts
- **WHEN** a script matches any dangerous pattern
- **THEN** the system SHALL return an error
- **AND** dangerous patterns SHALL include: recursive force delete (`rm -rf /`), fork bombs, pipe-to-shell (`curl|sh`), raw device writes (`>/dev/sd`), filesystem formatting (`mkfs.`), and raw disk copies (`dd if=`)

### Requirement: Skill Builder
The system SHALL provide a builder for constructing skill entries from tool execution traces.

#### Scenario: Build composite skill from steps
- **WHEN** `BuildFromSteps` is called with a name, description, and list of tool steps

- **THEN** the field SHALL be persisted through Save and restored through Get

### Requirement: Instruction skill type
The system SHALL support an `instruction` skill type for agent reference documents. Instruction skills store their entire markdown body as `definition["content"]`.

#### Scenario: Parse instruction SKILL.md
- **WHEN** a SKILL.md has no explicit `type` in frontmatter
- **THEN** the parser SHALL default to type `instruction` and store the body as content

#### Scenario: Parse instruction with explicit type
- **WHEN** a SKILL.md has `type: instruction` in frontmatter
- **THEN** the parser SHALL store the body as `definition["content"]`

### Requirement: Instruction skill as tool
Instruction skills SHALL be converted to agent tools. The tool description SHALL use the skill's original description (for agent reasoning). The handler SHALL return the full reference content, source, and description.

- **THEN** it SHALL return a map with skill name, type, and content

### Requirement: Source field roundtrip in SKILL.md
The parser and renderer SHALL preserve the `source` field in YAML frontmatter through parse/render cycles.

#### Scenario: Source field roundtrip
- **WHEN** a SKILL.md with a `source` field is parsed and re-rendered

- **THEN** the body SHALL contain the raw content without code block delimiters

### Requirement: BuildInstructionSkill builder
The system SHALL provide a `BuildInstructionSkill` function that creates an instruction SkillEntry with name, description, content, and source.

#### Scenario: Build instruction skill
- **WHEN** `BuildInstructionSkill("name", "desc", "content", "https://source")` is called
- **THEN** it SHALL return a SkillEntry with type=instruction, status=active, createdBy=import
