## Purpose

Telegram channel adapter for the Lango agent. Connects to Telegram via Bot API, handles message reception (DMs and groups), media attachments, allowlist filtering, approval workflows, Markdown formatting, and typing indicators.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Telegram bot connection
The system SHALL connect to Telegram using the Bot API with a provided bot token.

#### Scenario: Successful bot connection
- **WHEN** the application starts with a valid TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN
- **THEN** the system SHALL establish a connection to Telegram servers

#### Scenario: Invalid bot token
- **WHEN** the bot token is invalid or revoked
- **THEN** the system SHALL log an error and retry with exponential backoff

### Requirement: Message reception
The system SHALL receive and process incoming messages from Telegram chats. Message handling SHALL be dispatched to a separate goroutine so that the event loop remains non-blocking and can continue processing CallbackQuery updates concurrently.

#### Scenario: Direct message received
- **WHEN** a user sends a direct message to the bot
- **THEN** the message SHALL be forwarded to the agent with sender context

#### Scenario: Group message with mention
- **WHEN** a user mentions the bot in a group chat
- **THEN** the message SHALL be processed if mention-gating allows

#### Scenario: Concurrent callback processing during handler execution
- **WHEN** a message handler is blocking (e.g., waiting for tool approval)
- **AND** a CallbackQuery update arrives from a button click
- **THEN** the event loop SHALL process the CallbackQuery immediately without waiting for the handler to complete

#### Scenario: Graceful shutdown with active handlers
- **WHEN** the channel is stopped while message handlers are still executing
- **THEN** the system SHALL wait for all active handler goroutines to complete before returning from Stop()

### Requirement: Message sending
The Telegram channel SHALL auto-convert standard Markdown to Telegram v1 format in the Send() method when ParseMode is not explicitly set. On API parse failure, the system SHALL fallback to sending plain text without ParseMode. Messages with explicit ParseMode SHALL be sent as-is.

#### Scenario: Send text response
- **WHEN** the agent generates a text response
- **THEN** the response SHALL be sent to the originating chat

#### Scenario: Auto-format standard Markdown
- **WHEN** Send() is called with an OutgoingMessage where ParseMode is empty
- **THEN** the system converts the text via FormatMarkdown() and sends with ParseMode "Markdown"

#### Scenario: Plain text fallback on parse error
- **WHEN** the Telegram API rejects a message due to Markdown parse error
- **THEN** the system re-sends the original unformatted text without ParseMode

#### Scenario: Explicit ParseMode preserved
- **WHEN** Send() is called with ParseMode "HTML"
- **THEN** the system sends the text with ParseMode "HTML" without Markdown conversion

#### Scenario: Long message chunking preserved
- **WHEN** a formatted message exceeds 4096 characters
- **THEN** the system splits the message into chunks and sends each with Markdown formatting

### Requirement: Media handling
The system SHALL process media attachments from Telegram messages.

#### Scenario: Image attachment
- **WHEN** a user sends an image
- **THEN** the system SHALL download the image and provide it to the agent

#### Scenario: Document attachment
- **WHEN** a user sends a document
- **THEN** the system SHALL download and make it available for processing

### Requirement: Allowlist filtering
The system SHALL filter incoming messages based on configured allowlists.

#### Scenario: Allowed sender
- **WHEN** a message is from an allowed user/group
- **THEN** the message SHALL be processed normally

#### Scenario: Unknown sender
- **WHEN** a message is from an unknown sender and pairing is enabled
- **THEN** a pairing code SHALL be sent to the sender

### Requirement: Telegram approval provider
The Telegram channel SHALL provide an approval provider that uses InlineKeyboard buttons for tool execution approval.

#### Scenario: Approval message sent
- **WHEN** a sensitive tool approval is requested for a Telegram session
- **THEN** the system SHALL send a message with InlineKeyboard containing "Approve" and "Deny" buttons to the originating chat

#### Scenario: User approves
- **WHEN** the user clicks the "Approve" button
- **THEN** the callback query SHALL be answered
- **AND** the original message SHALL be edited to show approval status
- **AND** the tool execution SHALL proceed

#### Scenario: User denies
- **WHEN** the user clicks the "Deny" button
- **THEN** the callback query SHALL be answered
- **AND** the original message SHALL be edited to show denial status
- **AND** the tool execution SHALL be denied

#### Scenario: Approval timeout
- **WHEN** no button is clicked within the timeout period
- **THEN** the approval request SHALL be denied with a timeout error

#### Scenario: Context cancellation
- **WHEN** the request context is cancelled before a response
- **THEN** the approval request SHALL return the context error

### Requirement: Callback query routing
The Telegram channel event loop SHALL route CallbackQuery updates to the approval provider before processing regular messages.

#### Scenario: CallbackQuery received
- **WHEN** an update contains a CallbackQuery
- **THEN** the update SHALL be routed to the approval provider's HandleCallback method
- **AND** regular message processing SHALL be skipped for that update

### Requirement: BotAPI Request method
The BotAPI interface SHALL include a `Request` method for operations that return an APIResponse (e.g., AnswerCallbackQuery).

#### Scenario: Answer callback query
- **WHEN** a callback query needs to be acknowledged
- **THEN** the system SHALL use the `Request` method to send an AnswerCallbackQuery

### Requirement: Approval message editing on timeout and cancellation
The Telegram approval provider SHALL edit the approval message to display "Expired" status and remove inline keyboard buttons when the approval times out or the context is cancelled. The inline keyboard markup SHALL be constructed as a struct literal with an explicitly empty `InlineKeyboard` slice (`[][]InlineKeyboardButton{}`) to ensure JSON serialization produces `[]` rather than `null`.

#### Scenario: Timeout removes buttons
- **WHEN** an approval request times out without user response
- **THEN** the system SHALL edit the original message to "🔐 Tool approval — ⏱ Expired" with an empty inline keyboard markup serialized as `"inline_keyboard": []`

#### Scenario: Context cancellation removes buttons
- **WHEN** the approval request context is cancelled
- **THEN** the system SHALL edit the original message to "🔐 Tool approval — ⏱ Expired" with an empty inline keyboard markup serialized as `"inline_keyboard": []`

#### Scenario: Approval status removes buttons
- **WHEN** a user clicks the Approve or Deny button
- **THEN** the system SHALL edit the original message to show approval/denial status with an empty inline keyboard markup serialized as `"inline_keyboard": []`

### Requirement: Duplicate callback prevention via LoadAndDelete
The Telegram approval provider SHALL use `LoadAndDelete` as the first operation when handling callbacks to atomically claim the pending request and prevent duplicate processing.

#### Scenario: First callback succeeds
- **WHEN** a user clicks an approval button for a pending request
- **THEN** the system SHALL atomically load and delete the pending entry, deliver the result, and edit the message

#### Scenario: Duplicate callback is silently ignored
- **WHEN** a second callback arrives for an already-processed request
- **THEN** the system SHALL answer the callback silently without delivering a duplicate result

### Requirement: Error classification for callback and message operations
The Telegram approval provider SHALL classify API errors to suppress benign conditions at appropriate log levels.

#### Scenario: Expired callback query logged at debug level
- **WHEN** answering a callback fails with "query is too old" error
- **THEN** the system SHALL log at Debug level, not Warn level

#### Scenario: Message not modified error suppressed
- **WHEN** editing a message fails with "message is not modified" error
- **THEN** the system SHALL suppress the error without logging

### Requirement: Channel-safe Markdown formatting via agent prompt
The system SHALL include Markdown formatting conventions in the agent's conversation prompt that prevent Telegram Markdown v1 parse errors. The prompt rules SHALL instruct the LLM to avoid patterns that produce malformed Telegram markup.

#### Scenario: Bullet lists use dash syntax
- **WHEN** the agent generates an unordered list
- **THEN** the agent SHALL use `-` as the list marker, never `*`

#### Scenario: Code identifiers wrapped in backticks
- **WHEN** the agent references variable names, function names, or file paths containing underscores
- **THEN** the agent SHALL wrap them in backtick code spans to prevent underscore-as-italic parsing

#### Scenario: All formatting markers are paired
- **WHEN** the agent uses `*`, `_`, or `` ` `` markers
- **THEN** every opening marker SHALL have a corresponding closing marker

#### Scenario: Fenced code blocks are closed
- **WHEN** the agent opens a fenced code block with ` ``` `
- **THEN** the agent SHALL always include a closing ` ``` ` marker
### Requirement: Typing indicator during processing
The Telegram channel SHALL show a typing action indicator while the message handler processes a user message. The typing action SHALL be sent via `Request(ChatActionConfig)` immediately and refreshed every 4 seconds until the handler returns.

#### Scenario: Typing indicator during processing
- **WHEN** a user sends a message to the Telegram bot
- **THEN** the bot SHALL send a `ChatTyping` action to the chat before calling the handler
- **AND** SHALL refresh the typing action every 4 seconds
- **AND** SHALL stop refreshing when the handler returns

#### Scenario: Typing indicator API failure
- **WHEN** the `Request` call for typing action fails
- **THEN** the bot SHALL log a warning and continue processing normally
