## Requirements

### Requirement: Passphrase acquisition priority chain
The system SHALL acquire a passphrase using the following priority: (1) hardware keyring (Touch ID / TPM), (2) keyfile at `~/.lango/keyfile`, (3) interactive terminal prompt, (4) stdin pipe. The system SHALL return an error if no source is available.

#### Scenario: Keyfile exists with correct permissions
- **WHEN** a keyfile exists at the configured path with 0600 permissions
- **THEN** the passphrase is read from the file and `SourceKeyfile` is returned

#### Scenario: Keyfile has wrong permissions
- **WHEN** a keyfile exists but does not have 0600 permissions
- **THEN** the keyfile is skipped and the next source is tried

#### Scenario: Interactive terminal available
- **WHEN** no keyfile is available and stdin is a terminal
- **THEN** the user is prompted for a passphrase via hidden input and `SourceInteractive` is returned

#### Scenario: New passphrase creation
- **WHEN** `AllowCreation` is true and interactive terminal is used
- **THEN** the user is prompted twice (entry + confirmation) and the passphrase must match

#### Scenario: Stdin pipe
- **WHEN** no keyfile is available and stdin is a pipe (not a terminal)
- **THEN** one line is read from stdin and `SourceStdin` is returned

#### Scenario: No source available
- **WHEN** no keyfile exists, stdin is not a terminal, and stdin pipe is empty
- **THEN** the system returns an error

### Requirement: Log keyring read errors to stderr
When `passphrase.Acquire()` attempts to read from the OS keyring and receives an error other than `ErrNotFound`, it SHALL write a warning to stderr in the format: `warning: keyring read failed: <error>`. The function SHALL still fall through to the next passphrase source (keyfile, interactive, stdin).

#### Scenario: Keyring returns non-NotFound error
- **WHEN** `KeyringProvider.Get()` returns an error that is not `ErrNotFound`
- **THEN** stderr SHALL contain `warning: keyring read failed: <error detail>`
- **AND** acquisition SHALL continue to the next source

#### Scenario: Keyring returns ErrNotFound
- **WHEN** `KeyringProvider.Get()` returns `ErrNotFound`
- **THEN** no warning SHALL be written to stderr
- **AND** acquisition SHALL continue to the next source

### Requirement: Keyring provider is nil when no secure hardware is available
The passphrase acquisition flow SHALL receive a nil `KeyringProvider` when the bootstrap determines no secure hardware backend is available (`TierNone`). This effectively disables keyring auto-read, forcing keyfile or interactive/stdin acquisition.

#### Scenario: Nil keyring provider skips keyring step
- **WHEN** `Acquire()` is called with `KeyringProvider` set to nil
- **THEN** the keyring step SHALL be skipped entirely, and acquisition SHALL proceed to keyfile or interactive prompt

#### Scenario: Secure keyring provider attempts read
- **WHEN** `Acquire()` is called with a non-nil `KeyringProvider` (biometric or TPM)
- **THEN** it SHALL attempt to read the passphrase from the secure provider first

### Requirement: Keyfile management
The system SHALL read, write, and securely shred keyfiles with strict 0600 permission enforcement.

#### Scenario: Write keyfile
- **WHEN** a keyfile is written
- **THEN** the file is created with 0600 permissions and parent directories with 0700

#### Scenario: Read keyfile with valid permissions
- **WHEN** a keyfile is read with 0600 permissions
- **THEN** the passphrase is returned with trailing whitespace trimmed

#### Scenario: Read keyfile with invalid permissions
- **WHEN** a keyfile exists with permissions other than 0600
- **THEN** the system returns a permission validation error

#### Scenario: Shred keyfile
- **WHEN** `ShredKeyfile()` is called on an existing keyfile
- **THEN** the file content is overwritten with zero bytes, synced, and removed

#### Scenario: Shred nonexistent keyfile
- **WHEN** `ShredKeyfile()` is called on a nonexistent file
- **THEN** nil is returned without error
