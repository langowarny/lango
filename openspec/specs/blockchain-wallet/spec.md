## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Wallet provider interface
The system SHALL define a `WalletProvider` interface with methods: `Address`, `Balance`, `SignTransaction`, `SignMessage`, and `PublicKey`. All implementations MUST ensure private keys are never returned to callers.

The pre-existing `WalletProvider` methods SHALL remain unchanged in signature and semantics:

- `Address(ctx context.Context) (string, error)` — returns the wallet's checksummed Ethereum address
- `Balance(ctx context.Context) (*big.Int, error)` — returns native token balance in wei
- `SignTransaction(ctx context.Context, rawTx []byte) ([]byte, error)` — signs a raw transaction
- `SignMessage(ctx context.Context, message []byte) ([]byte, error)` — signs an arbitrary message

The `PublicKey(ctx context.Context) ([]byte, error)` method SHALL return the compressed secp256k1 public key bytes (33 bytes) corresponding to the wallet's private key. The private key MUST NOT be exposed by this or any other method. The returned public key SHALL be deterministic: repeated calls with the same wallet MUST return the same bytes.

`PublicKey` is required for P2P identity derivation: the DID system calls `WalletProvider.PublicKey()` to derive `did:lango:<hex-pubkey>` and the corresponding libp2p peer ID. P2P is gated on `payment.enabled`; therefore `PublicKey` is only called when a wallet is present.

Adding `PublicKey` to the interface constitutes a breaking change for any external implementations. Internal implementations (`LocalWallet`, `RPCWallet`, `CompositeWallet`) MUST all implement `PublicKey` before the interface change is merged.

#### Scenario: Get wallet address
- **WHEN** `Address(ctx)` is called on any WalletProvider implementation
- **THEN** the wallet's public Ethereum address is returned as a hex string

#### Scenario: Sign transaction
- **WHEN** `SignTransaction(ctx, rawTx)` is called with a transaction hash
- **THEN** a secp256k1 signature is returned and the private key bytes are zeroed immediately after

#### Scenario: PublicKey returns 33-byte compressed public key
- **WHEN** `WalletProvider.PublicKey(ctx)` is called on a wallet initialized with an ECDSA keypair
- **THEN** the method SHALL return a 33-byte slice (compressed secp256k1 format, prefix `0x02` or `0x03`)

#### Scenario: PublicKey is deterministic
- **WHEN** `WalletProvider.PublicKey(ctx)` is called multiple times on the same wallet
- **THEN** all calls SHALL return identical byte slices

#### Scenario: PublicKey never exposes private key
- **WHEN** `WalletProvider.PublicKey(ctx)` is called
- **THEN** the returned bytes SHALL contain only the public key; the private key bytes SHALL NOT appear in any return value or log output

#### Scenario: All WalletProvider implementations satisfy interface
- **WHEN** the codebase is compiled
- **THEN** all types that implemented the previous `WalletProvider` interface (`LocalWallet`, `RPCWallet`, `CompositeWallet`) SHALL implement `PublicKey` and satisfy the updated interface at compile time

#### Scenario: PublicKey error propagates to DID derivation
- **WHEN** `WalletProvider.PublicKey(ctx)` returns an error (e.g., wallet not initialized, RPC failure)
- **THEN** `WalletDIDProvider.DID(ctx)` SHALL return a wrapped error containing "get wallet public key" and SHALL NOT cache a nil result

#### Scenario: Existing wallet methods continue to function
- **WHEN** `WalletProvider.Address(ctx)` is called on any implementation after the interface extension
- **THEN** the method SHALL return the same result as before the change (no regression)

#### Scenario: Compile-time interface compliance check
- **WHEN** the package containing `LocalWallet` is compiled
- **THEN** the compile-time assertion `var _ WalletProvider = (*LocalWallet)(nil)` SHALL succeed without error

### Requirement: Local wallet with encrypted key storage
The system SHALL implement a `LocalWallet` that loads its private key from `SecretsStore` under key `wallet.privatekey`, signs using go-ethereum crypto, and zeroes key bytes immediately after each operation.

#### Scenario: Local wallet signs transaction
- **WHEN** `SignTransaction` is called on LocalWallet
- **THEN** the key is loaded from SecretsStore, the transaction is signed, and the key bytes are zeroed

#### Scenario: Local wallet derives address
- **WHEN** `Address` is called on LocalWallet
- **THEN** the address is derived from the stored private key via publicKey -> keccak256

### Requirement: RPC wallet for companion delegation
The system SHALL implement an `RPCWallet` that delegates signing to a companion app via WebSocket RPC, using correlation IDs and 30-second timeout, mirroring the `security.RPCProvider` pattern.

#### Scenario: RPC wallet signs with companion
- **WHEN** `SignTransaction` is called on RPCWallet with a connected companion
- **THEN** a `wallet.sign_tx.request` message is sent and the response is awaited with 30s timeout

#### Scenario: RPC wallet times out
- **WHEN** the companion does not respond within 30 seconds
- **THEN** a timeout error is returned

### Requirement: Composite wallet with fallback
The system SHALL implement a `CompositeWallet` that uses RPCWallet when companion is connected and falls back to LocalWallet, mirroring the `CompositeCryptoProvider` pattern.

#### Scenario: Composite wallet uses primary
- **WHEN** `ConnectionChecker.IsConnected()` returns true
- **THEN** the RPCWallet (primary) is used for signing

#### Scenario: Composite wallet falls back to local
- **WHEN** `ConnectionChecker.IsConnected()` returns false
- **THEN** the LocalWallet (fallback) is used for signing

### Requirement: Wallet creation with encrypted key storage
The system SHALL provide a `CreateWallet` function in the wallet package that generates a new ECDSA private key using `crypto.GenerateKey()`, stores it encrypted in SecretsStore under key `wallet.privatekey`, and returns the derived public address. The private key bytes MUST be zeroed immediately after storage.

#### Scenario: Create new wallet when none exists
- **WHEN** `CreateWallet(ctx, secrets)` is called and no `wallet.privatekey` exists in SecretsStore
- **THEN** a new ECDSA key is generated, stored encrypted under `wallet.privatekey`, and the public address is returned as a hex string

#### Scenario: Reject creation when wallet already exists
- **WHEN** `CreateWallet(ctx, secrets)` is called and `wallet.privatekey` already exists in SecretsStore
- **THEN** an error is returned indicating a wallet already exists, along with the existing wallet's address

#### Scenario: Private key is zeroed after storage
- **WHEN** a new wallet is created successfully
- **THEN** the raw private key bytes are zeroed in memory immediately after being written to SecretsStore

### Requirement: SpendingLimiter auto-approve threshold
SpendingLimiter interface SHALL include `IsAutoApprovable(ctx context.Context, amount *big.Int) (bool, error)` for threshold-based auto-approval decisions. EntSpendingLimiter SHALL implement this method using the `autoApproveBelow` field.

#### Scenario: IsAutoApprovable returns true for amount below threshold
- **WHEN** autoApproveBelow is "0.10" and amount is 0.05 USDC and daily limit is not exceeded
- **THEN** IsAutoApprovable SHALL return (true, nil)

#### Scenario: IsAutoApprovable returns false for amount above threshold
- **WHEN** autoApproveBelow is "0.10" and amount is 0.50 USDC
- **THEN** IsAutoApprovable SHALL return (false, nil)

#### Scenario: IsAutoApprovable returns false when threshold is zero
- **WHEN** autoApproveBelow is "0" or empty
- **THEN** IsAutoApprovable SHALL return (false, nil) regardless of amount

#### Scenario: IsAutoApprovable returns error when daily limit exceeded
- **WHEN** amount is below threshold but daily spending limit would be exceeded
- **THEN** IsAutoApprovable SHALL return (false, error) with the limit error

### Requirement: EntSpendingLimiter autoApproveBelow parameter
NewEntSpendingLimiter SHALL accept an `autoApproveBelow` string parameter (4th argument) representing the USDC amount threshold for auto-approval. Empty string or "0" SHALL disable auto-approval.

#### Scenario: Valid autoApproveBelow value
- **WHEN** NewEntSpendingLimiter is called with autoApproveBelow "0.10"
- **THEN** the limiter SHALL store the parsed threshold as 100000 (smallest USDC units)

#### Scenario: Empty autoApproveBelow disables auto-approval
- **WHEN** NewEntSpendingLimiter is called with autoApproveBelow ""
- **THEN** the limiter SHALL set autoApproveBelow to 0 (disabled)

#### Scenario: Invalid autoApproveBelow returns error
- **WHEN** NewEntSpendingLimiter is called with autoApproveBelow "invalid"
- **THEN** NewEntSpendingLimiter SHALL return an error
