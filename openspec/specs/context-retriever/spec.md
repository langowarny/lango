### Requirement: Keyword Extraction
The system SHALL extract meaningful keywords from user queries for search. The `extractKeywords` function SHALL extract at most 5 keywords from a query string. Each keyword SHALL be at most 50 characters long. Keywords SHALL contain only alphanumeric characters, hyphens, and underscores after sanitization. Keywords shorter than 2 characters after sanitization SHALL be excluded.

#### Scenario: Query with only stop words
- **WHEN** a query "the a is are was" is processed
- **THEN** nil is returned (no keywords extracted)

#### Scenario: Special character sanitization
- **WHEN** a query contains characters like `@`, `#`, `$`, `(`, `)`, etc.
- **THEN** those characters are stripped from keywords during sanitization

#### Scenario: Long keyword truncation
- **WHEN** a single word exceeds 50 characters
- **THEN** it is truncated to 50 characters

### Requirement: Prompt Assembly

- **THEN** the system SHALL return the base prompt unchanged

#### Scenario: Context sections
- **WHEN** `AssemblePrompt` is called with retrieved items
- **THEN** the system SHALL append markdown sections for each layer with items:
  - "Runtime Context" for runtime context items
  - "Available Tools" for tool registry items
  - "User Knowledge" for user knowledge items
  - "Known Solutions" for agent learnings
  - "Available Skills" for skill patterns
  - "External References" for external knowledge

#### Scenario: Section ordering
- **WHEN** `AssemblePrompt` is called with items from multiple layers
- **THEN** "Runtime Context" SHALL appear before "Available Tools"
- **AND** "Available Tools" SHALL appear before "User Knowledge"

#### Scenario: Observation memory section
- **WHEN** `AssemblePrompt` is called with observations or reflections
- **THEN** the system SHALL append a "Conversation Memory" section after knowledge sections
- **AND** reflections SHALL appear before observations within that section

#### Scenario: Inquiries present in context
- **WHEN** AssemblePrompt is called with LayerPendingInquiries items
- **THEN** the output includes a "## Pending Knowledge Inquiries" section with each inquiry formatted as `- [topic] question (context: why)`

#### Scenario: No inquiries
- **WHEN** no LayerPendingInquiries items exist
- **THEN** no inquiry section is included in the prompt

### Requirement: Context-Aware Model Adapter
The system SHALL wrap the ADK model adapter to transparently inject retrieved context and observational memory.

#### Scenario: System prompt augmentation
- **WHEN** `GenerateContent` is called on the context-aware adapter
- **THEN** the system SHALL extract the user's latest message as query
- **AND** retrieve relevant context from all 6 layers (Runtime Context, Tool Registry, User Knowledge, Skill Patterns, External Knowledge, Agent Learnings)
- **AND** update the runtime adapter's session state before retrieval
- **AND** retrieve observations and reflections for the current session
- **AND** augment the system instruction with assembled context including observations
- **AND** forward the modified request to the underlying model adapter

### Requirement: Tool Registry Provider Interface
The system SHALL define a `ToolRegistryProvider` interface for supplying available tool information to the context retriever.

#### Scenario: List all tools
- **WHEN** `ListTools()` is called on a `ToolRegistryProvider`
- **THEN** the system SHALL return all registered `ToolDescriptor` entries

#### Scenario: Search tools by query

- **THEN** the system SHALL return tools whose name or description contains the query (case-insensitive)
- **AND** the result SHALL contain at most `limit` items

### Requirement: Runtime Context Provider Interface
The system SHALL define a `RuntimeContextProvider` interface for supplying session and system state.

#### Scenario: Get runtime context

### Requirement: Tool Registry Retrieval
The system SHALL retrieve matching tools when the Tool Registry layer is requested.

#### Scenario: Retrieve tools by keyword
- **WHEN** `Retrieve` is called with `LayerToolRegistry` in the layer list
- **AND** a `ToolRegistryProvider` is configured

#### Scenario: Nil tool provider

- **THEN** the system SHALL return zero items for that layer without error

### Requirement: Runtime Context Retrieval

#### Scenario: Nil runtime provider
- **WHEN** `Retrieve` is called with `LayerRuntimeContext` in the layer list
- **AND** no `RuntimeContextProvider` is configured
- **THEN** the system SHALL return zero items for that layer without error

### Requirement: Tool Registry Adapter
The system SHALL provide a `ToolRegistryAdapter` that adapts `[]*agent.Tool` to `ToolRegistryProvider`.

#### Scenario: Boundary copy on construction
- **WHEN** a `ToolRegistryAdapter` is created with a tool slice
- **THEN** the adapter SHALL copy the slice so external mutations do not affect internal state

#### Scenario: Case-insensitive search
- **WHEN** `SearchTools` is called with a query
- **THEN** the adapter SHALL match tools using case-insensitive substring comparison on name and description

### Requirement: Runtime Context Adapter
The system SHALL provide a `RuntimeContextAdapter` with thread-safe session updates.

- **WHEN** a `RuntimeContextAdapter` is created without calling `SetSession`
- **THEN** the channel type SHALL be "direct"

#### Scenario: Derive channel type from session key
- **WHEN** `SetSession` is called with a session key in the format "channel:id:subid"

#### Scenario: Thread-safe access
- **WHEN** `SetSession` and `GetRuntimeContext` are called concurrently
- **THEN** the adapter SHALL use mutex protection to prevent data races

### Requirement: InquiryProvider Interface
