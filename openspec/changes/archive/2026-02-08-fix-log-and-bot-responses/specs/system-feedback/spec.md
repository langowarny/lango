## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Non-blocking startup security
The system SHALL prioritize environment-based security credentials (LANGO_PASSPHRASE) over interactive prompts to ensure automated and remote startups are not blocked.

#### Scenario: Passphrase provided via environment
- **WHEN** the `LANGO_PASSPHRASE` environment variable is set
- **THEN** the system SHALL use it and SKIP any interactive prompts, even in a TTY environment.

#### Scenario: Passphrase missing in interactive session
- **WHEN** `LANGO_PASSPHRASE` is NOT set AND the session is interactive (TTY)
- **THEN** the system SHALL prompt the user for the passphrase.

#### Scenario: Passphrase missing in headless environment
- **WHEN** `LANGO_PASSPHRASE` is NOT set AND the session is NOT interactive
- **THEN** the system SHALL terminate with a descriptive error.

### Requirement: System lifecycle visibility
The system SHALL provide granular logging during its startup and initialization phase to inform the user of the status of each core component.

#### Scenario: Component initialization feedback
- **WHEN** a major component (Supervisor, Agent, Gateway, Channel) starts initializing
- **THEN** the system SHALL log its progress and reporting any success or failure immediately.

#### Scenario: Gateway and Bot readiness
- **WHEN** all components are successfully initialized and listening
- **THEN** the system SHALL log a clear "Ready" message including the server address and names of active bot channels.
