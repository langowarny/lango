## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Testability Interfaces
The system SHALL define and use internal interfaces for all external channel dependencies (Discord, Slack, Telegram) to enable dependency injection and mocking.

#### Scenario: Unit Testing with Mocks
- **WHEN** a unit test is executed for a channel implementation
- **THEN** the test SHALL be able to inject a mock implementation of the client interface
- **AND** the test SHALL be able to verify interactions (e.g., messages sent) without making network calls
- **AND** the channel logic SHALL operate identically as with the real client

### Requirement: Client Adapters
The system SHALL provide adapter implementations that wrap the concrete external library clients to satisfy the testability interfaces.

#### Scenario: Production Execution
- **WHEN** the application starts in production mode
- **THEN** the real external library clients are instantiated
- **AND** they are wrapped in the corresponding adapters
- **AND** injected into the Channel instances
