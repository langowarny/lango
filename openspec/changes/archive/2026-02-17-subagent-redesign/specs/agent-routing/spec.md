## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: AgentSpec registry defines sub-agent identity and routing metadata
The system SHALL define an `AgentSpec` type with fields: Name, Description, Instruction, Prefixes, Keywords, Accepts, Returns, CannotDo, and AlwaysInclude. A `var agentSpecs` registry SHALL contain specs for all 6 sub-agents in creation order.

#### Scenario: AgentSpec type has all required fields
- **WHEN** the AgentSpec type is defined
- **THEN** it SHALL include Name (string), Description (string), Instruction (string), Prefixes ([]string), Keywords ([]string), Accepts (string), Returns (string), CannotDo ([]string), and AlwaysInclude (bool)

#### Scenario: Registry contains exactly 6 specs
- **WHEN** agentSpecs is initialized
- **THEN** it SHALL contain specs for operator, navigator, vault, librarian, planner, and chronicler in that order

#### Scenario: Each spec has unique name
- **WHEN** agentSpecs is iterated
- **THEN** no two specs SHALL have the same Name

### Requirement: Routing table in orchestrator prompt
The orchestrator instruction SHALL contain a structured routing table listing each sub-agent with its role, keywords, accepts/returns format, and cannot-do constraints.

#### Scenario: Routing table format
- **WHEN** the orchestrator instruction is generated
- **THEN** it SHALL contain a `### <agent-name>` section for each active sub-agent
- **AND** each section SHALL include Role, Keywords, Accepts, Returns, and Cannot fields

#### Scenario: Only active agents in routing table
- **WHEN** some agents have no tools and are not AlwaysInclude
- **THEN** the routing table SHALL only list agents that were actually created

### Requirement: Decision protocol in orchestrator prompt
The orchestrator instruction SHALL include a 5-step decision protocol: CLASSIFY, MATCH, SELECT, VERIFY, DELEGATE.

#### Scenario: Decision protocol presence
- **WHEN** the orchestrator instruction is generated
- **THEN** it SHALL contain the steps CLASSIFY, MATCH, SELECT, VERIFY, and DELEGATE

### Requirement: Reject protocol for misrouted tasks
Each sub-agent instruction SHALL include a `[REJECT]` response protocol. When a sub-agent receives a task outside its capabilities, it SHALL respond with `[REJECT] This task requires <correct_agent>. I handle: <capabilities>.`

#### Scenario: All sub-agent instructions contain reject protocol
- **WHEN** any sub-agent's instruction is checked
- **THEN** it SHALL contain the string `[REJECT]`

#### Scenario: Orchestrator handles rejections
- **WHEN** a sub-agent rejects a task
- **THEN** the orchestrator SHALL try the next most relevant agent or handle directly

### Requirement: Keywords for routing decisions
Each AgentSpec SHALL define keywords that the orchestrator uses to match user requests to agents.

#### Scenario: All specs have keywords
- **WHEN** agentSpecs is iterated
- **THEN** every spec SHALL have a non-empty Keywords slice

#### Scenario: Operator keywords
- **WHEN** the operator spec is checked
- **THEN** its Keywords SHALL include: run, execute, command, shell, file

#### Scenario: Navigator keywords
- **WHEN** the navigator spec is checked
- **THEN** its Keywords SHALL include: browse, web, url, page, navigate

#### Scenario: Vault keywords
- **WHEN** the vault spec is checked
- **THEN** its Keywords SHALL include: encrypt, decrypt, sign, secret, payment, wallet

### Requirement: Unmatched tools reported in orchestrator prompt
When tools match no agent prefix, the orchestrator instruction SHALL list them under an "Unmatched Tools" section.

#### Scenario: Unmatched tools present
- **WHEN** unmatched tools exist
- **THEN** the orchestrator instruction SHALL contain "Unmatched Tools" with the tool names listed

#### Scenario: No unmatched tools
- **WHEN** all tools match a prefix
- **THEN** the orchestrator instruction SHALL NOT contain "Unmatched Tools"

### Requirement: Sub-agent instructions follow structured format
Every sub-agent instruction SHALL contain four sections: "What You Do", "Input Format", "Output Format", and "Constraints".

#### Scenario: Instruction structure
- **WHEN** any agentSpec's instruction is checked
- **THEN** it SHALL contain `## What You Do`, `## Input Format`, `## Output Format`, and `## Constraints`

### Requirement: Accepts and Returns metadata
Every AgentSpec SHALL define Accepts (input format description) and Returns (output format description) for the routing table.

#### Scenario: All specs have I/O metadata
- **WHEN** agentSpecs is iterated
- **THEN** every spec SHALL have non-empty Accepts and Returns fields
